          This visualization was found on Reddit, showing the Hunger Games
          checkouts overtime in Seattle library.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, the visualization is static, showing the data from a 
          13GB csv with over 100 million rows of checkouts. The data was processed 
          by Reddit user u/Thatshelbs and the graph was made by using Tableau.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator of this image uses color hue to represent different categories 
          of things. He uses position in x-axis to represent time, and  
          height(or the span in y-axis, although there is no y-axis in the graph) 
          to represent quantity of the checkouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the creator was trying to make this visualization, his mean purpose was 
          probably to show how the amount of checkouts changed overtime. So he had to 
          come up with different visual channels to represent time and quantity of checkouts. 
          He ended up choosing position to represent time probably because it's the best way 
          to make things clear. And he chose the height of the waveform to represent the amount 
          of checkouts so that readers can easily tell how the amount varied overtime. 
          Maybe he saw some additional information in the csv and suddenly came up with an idea 
          that he should do some comparison between different objects. So he needed a visual channel 
          to represent different objects. Color hue was a good choice because there were not 
          too many objects to be shown, and color hue could just seperate things in a not confusing 
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally think this is a good visualization because this graph shows the Hunger Games checkouts 
          in Seattle library pretty clearly. Although I didn't expect any comparison with other objects in the 
          graph because the title didn't say that, these additional information didn't make the graph hard to 
          understand. The legend is clear, and the creator very wisely chose the proper visual channels to represent 
          different kinds of information. Readers can read the visualization intuitively so this visualization is 
          pretty successful.
